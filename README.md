## Core Philosophy: Build Projects Worth Showing Off That Also Teach
I have a signature dish that I cook to impress dates, one I learned from my dad, that he learned from my great uncle. I like to cook chicken cordon bleu. It seems fancy, it has a high presentation value, a french sounding name, but is in actuality not complicated to make. It’s the optimal amount of being impressive while simultaneously within reasonable effort.  
  
I also believe that we should be creating more portfolio worthy pieces as we create. So I’ve optimized that should we complete a full day’s worth of work we will be rewarded with a portfolio worthy piece, one that we could show screenshots of on a homepage or a github profile, one that even non technical people would be impressed with. I believe that anyone with enough portfolio pieces should have little trouble finding a job or freelance work. My aim is that anyone who finishes this piscine should afterwards have enough work to show to land themselves a career making apps (which pays a lot more than web dev) swift/ios developers are also higher paid than those who make for android.  
  
So that’s the goal, everyday we have micro projects that build in the appropriate order of most important first, up toward a portfolio piece, the rushes are similarly structured to use principles from the days preceding to be a kind of superproject that builds on the principles previously introduced the week earlier.  
  
I will need all of your help to call me out on things where it doesn’t make sense, isn’t clear, is too easy, too similar, or too difficult of a project. The workload should be about 8 hours per day.
