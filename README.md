# Swift-Piscine-Curriculum-at-42
I was asked by staff to make new curriculum for Swift and IOS at my school.  
This was what was created, so far we have completed the alpha test and I am implementing changes based on student's feedback for the Beta. 

## Core Philosophy: Build Projects Worth Showing Off That Also Teach
I have a philosophy about projects that I think we should create portfolio worthy pieces as we code. So I’ve optimized this that should we complete a full day’s worth of work we will be rewarded with a portfolio worthy piece. I believe that anyone with enough portfolio pieces should have little trouble finding a job or freelance work. My aim is that anyone who finishes this piscine should afterwards have enough projects to show in order to land themselves a career making apps for IOS.
  
So that’s the goal, everyday we have micro projects that build in the appropriate order starting with the most important principles first then building up to a portfolio piece. The rushes (weekend group projects) are similarly structured to use principles from the days preceding to be a kind of super-project that builds on the principles previously introduced in the days earlier.

What's been difficult has been balancing the difficulty. It should take each student roughly 8 hours of work a day, and is set up such that less advanced students will finish the first half of the day while feeling challenged while the more advanced students would finish the day to completion also feeling challenged and taking a similar amount of time to finish. Which means that we are not only building on principles but designing each half day of the assignment for two different user scenarios of students.  
  
If you find any problems, have questions or notice flaws in my explanations please reach out to me so that I can fix it. 

Swift is a beautiful language, and I hope those who follow these projects will grow to love it as I have.
